## About the project
1. With the rise in the rate of urbanisation of areas, the loss of natural land cover has grown exponentially.
2. Cities have started replacing natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavements, buildings and other surface with retain heat.
3. This effect increases energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning), air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality.
4. Trees, green roofs, and vegetation can help reduce urban heat island effects by shading building surfaces, deflecting radiation from the sun, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere.
5. Hence, we propose a Autonomous Drone For Mapping Areas With Lost Natural Land Cover.
6. This would help city officials in strategically planting trees and vegetation in an area to reduce the effects of the loss of land cover and help regulate temperatures around the area.
